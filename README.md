This  VS Code extension provides interactive IDE features for [Viper](http://viper.ethz.ch) — the Verification Infrastructure for Permission-based Reasoning. 

### Dependencies ###

The extension automatically downloads and manages Viper (via publicly available links, as listed here: http://viper.ethz.ch/downloads/). 

Viper IDE uses an open-source 64-bit [Java server](https://github.com/viperproject/viperserver), so you need Java (version 11 or newer) installed to be able to run it. 

Please **always** refer to the official [installation instructions](http://viper.ethz.ch/downloads) for more details (in particular, about different operating system support). 

### Using Viper ###

If you would like to learn more about Viper, please start with our extensive [tutorial](http://viper.ethz.ch/tutorial/).
